In this project, I performed comprehensive SQL-based analysis on a bookstore database containing tables such as Books, Customers, and Orders. 
I wrote both basic and advanced SQL queries to extract insights related to book inventory, customer activity, and revenue performance.

Key tasks included:

Filtering books by genre (e.g., Fiction, Fantasy) and publication year.

Retrieving customer data based on geographical filters (e.g., customers from Canada).

Extracting time-based sales trends (e.g., orders in November 2023).

Performing aggregation functions to calculate total stock, total revenue, and book sales per genre.

Using SQL JOINs to connect multiple tables for accurate customer order data.

Applying COALESCE() to handle missing or NULL values in key financial and inventory fields.

Identifying top-selling books, most expensive items, and customers with the highest spending.

Writing subqueries and grouping operations to get advanced metrics such as most frequently ordered book,
 cities with high-spending customers,
 and remaining stock after fulfilling orders.

I also utilized sorting (ORDER BY), grouping (GROUP BY), 
and filtering (HAVING) clauses extensively to handle real-world business requirements in the bookstore context. 
This project helped strengthen my ability to design and optimize queries for both exploratory and operational reporting.
